Dear Git,
	<br>
	I love how when we create more of a history with each other we become even more 'commited'. I like it when you play hard to get and 'pull' away from me. I really like your bestfriend, Github as well, and I love how you introduced me to them. You have so many sides to you, each one is as unique as the one before. I hope to continue to learn things from our relationship. 
	<br>
	Love,
	Grace
