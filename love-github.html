Dear Github,
	<br>
	I like how you are uncomplicated and how I feel like I can easily read who you are. I like how many similar intrests we have with each other like coding, which allows us to work on projects together. I adore how you have taken an interest in including my friends when we hang out, it means a lot to me. It's really cool how you are interested in the projects I create in my free time, and how you want to show them to the world. I adore how resourceful you are. 
	<br>
	Love,
	Grace
